The following codes are developed for reading the adc value from the iduino analog sensor. A seperate adc had to be purchased for the rpi since the rpi does not support adc conversion.

The Address of the adc can be configured with the following hardwiring:
ADDRESS PIN       	   SLAVE ADDDRESS
Gnd			   0x48
VDD			   0x49
SDA			   0x4A
SCL			   0x4B
